<h2>Elizabeth Barndollar</h2>
<p>My objective is to never stop growing professionally and personally. I spend a lot of time examining myself, developing my skills, and studying to better myself for my job and as an individual. I try to constantly improve myself so I can be a better teammate, mentor, friend, volunteer, and leader.</p>
